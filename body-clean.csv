When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*

-CBD Isolate: A refined powder that has been stripped down to contain virtually pure CBD. No other compounds of the hemp plant are included.
-Testing: Every batch is tested three times. Testing is done on the raw hemp, the cannabinoid extract, and the final formula when manufactured.

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*
